#' Bit Vectors Implementation of FLAME
#'
#' \code{FLAME} runs the bit-vectors implementation of the FLAME algorithm.
#'
#' @section Introduction:
#' FLAME is a matching algorithm for causal inference that matches units if they
#' match exactly on certain covariates. It starts by making any possible matches
#' on all covariates. It then drops a covariate, makes any possible matches on
#' the remaining covariates, and repeats this process until stopping. The
#' covariate dropped at any given iteration is the one yielding the greatest
#' match quality \eqn{MQ}, defined as \eqn{MQ = C \times BF - PE}. Here,
#' \eqn{BF} denotes the balancing factor, defined as the proportion of unmatched
#' control units, plus the proportion of unmatched treated units, that can now
#' be matched by dropping that covariate. And \eqn{PE} denotes the prediction
#' error, defined as the training error incurred when predicting the outcome
#' from covariates on a separate, holdout set. In this way, FLAME encourages
#' making many matches and also matching on covariates important to the outcome.
#' The hyperparameter \eqn{C} controls the balance between these two objectives.
#' For more details, please see the FLAME paper
#' \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06315.pdf}{here}.
#'
#' @section Stopping Rules:
#' By default, \code{FLAME} stops when 1. all covariates have been dropped or 2.
#' all treatment or control units have been matched. This behavior can be
#' modified by the arguments whose prefix is "early_stop". With the exception of
#' \code{early_stop_iterations}, all the rules come into play \emph{before} the
#' offending covariate is dropped. That is, if \code{early_stop_BF = 0.2} and at
#' the current iteration, dropping the covariate leading to highest match
#' quality is associated with a balancing factor of 0.1, FLAME stops
#' \emph{without} dropping this covariate.
#'
#' @section Missing Data:
#' \code{FLAME} offers functionality for handling missing data in the
#' covariates, for both the \code{data} and \code{holdout} sets. This
#' functionality can be specified via the arguments whose prefix is "missing" or
#' "impute". It allows for ignoring missing data, imputing it, or (for
#' \code{data}) not matching on missing values. If \code{data} is imputed, the
#' FLAME algorithm will be run on all imputations. If \code{holdout} is imputed,
#' the predictive error at an iteration will be the average of predictive errors
#' across all imputed \code{holdout} datasets.
#'
#'
#' @param data Data to be matched. Either a data frame or a path to a .csv file
#'   to be read into a data frame. If path to a .csv file, all covariates will
#'   be assumed to be categorical Treatment must be described by a logical or
#'   binary column with name \code{treated_column_name}. Outcome, if supplied,
#'   must be either binary continuous (both numeric). If not supplied, matching
#'   will be performed but matched group CATEs will not be returned and
#'   post-matching, treatment effect estimation will not be possible. All non-
#'   outcome or treatment columns will be treated as covariates for matching. If
#'   they are factors, they will be assumed to be categorical; if they are
#'   numeric, they will be assumed continuous and binned into categories as
#'   specified by \code{binning_method}. \emph{Any covariates that are not
#'   continuous, on which units are to match exactly, must be passed to FLAME as
#'   factors}. The input of continuous covariates is not recommended. In
#'   addition, if a supplied factor has k levels, they must be: 0, 1, ..., k -
#'   1. This will change in a future update. There is no default for
#'   \code{data}.
#' @param holdout Holdout data to be used to compute predictive error. If a
#'   numeric scalar between 0 and 1, that proportion of \code{data} will be made
#'   into a holdout set and only the remaining proportion of \code{data} will be
#'   matched. Otherwise, a dataframe or a path to a .csv file. If a path to a
#'   .csv file, all covariates will be assumed to be categorical Restrictions on
#'   column types are the same as for \code{data}. Must have the same column
#'   names and order as \code{data}. This data will \emph{not} be matched.
#'   Defaults to 0.1.
#' @param C A finite, positive scalar denoting the tradeoff between BF and PE in
#'   the FLAME algorithm. Higher C prioritizes more matches and lower C
#'   prioritizes not dropping important covariates. Defaults to 0.1.
#' @param treated_column_name A character with the name of the treatment column
#'   in \code{data} and \code{holdout}. Defaults to 'treated'.
#' @param outcome_column_name A character with the name of the outcome column in
#'   \code{holdout} and also in \code{data}, if supplied in the latter.
#'   Defaults to 'outcome'.
#' @param binning_method The method to be used to bin continuous covariates in
#'   the data. One of: "sturges", "scott", or "fd", denoting Sturges' rule,
#'   Scott's rule, or the Freedman-Diaconis rule for determining number of bins
#'   in a histogram. Each continuous covariate will be binned into the
#'   corresponding number of bins. If covariates are binned, the \code{data}
#'   entry of the object returned from \code{FLAME} will contain the binned,
#'   and not the original, values. Defaults to 'sturges'.
#' @param PE_method Either "ridge" or "xgb". Denotes the method to be used to
#'   compute PE. If "ridge", uses \code{glmnet::cv.glmnet} with default
#'   parameters and then the default predict method to estimate the outcome. If
#'   "xgb", uses \code{xgboost::xgb.cv} on a wide range of parameter values to
#'   cross-validate and find the best with respect to RMSE (for continuous
#'   outcomes) or binary misclassification rate (for binary outcomes). Then uses
#'   the default predict method to estimate the outcome. Defaults to "ridge".
#' @param user_PE_fit An optional function supplied by the user that can be used
#'   instead of those allowed for by \code{PE_method} to fit a model fitting the
#'   outcome from the covariates. Must take in a matrix of covariates as its
#'   first argument and a vector outcome as its second argument. Defaults to
#'   \code{NULL}.
#' @param user_PE_fit_params A named list of optional parameters to be used by
#'   \code{user_PE_fit}. Defaults to \code{NULL}.
#' @param user_PE_predict An optional function supplied by the user that can be
#'   used to generate predictions from the output of \code{user_PE_fit}. As its
#'   first argument, must take an object of the type returned by
#'  \code{user_PE_fit} and as its second, a matrix of values for which to
#'  generate predictions. If not supplied, defaults to \code{predict}.
#' @param user_PE_predict_params A named list of optional parameters to be used
#'   by \code{user_PE_predict}. Defaults to \code{NULL}.
#' @param replace A logical scalar. If \code{TRUE}, allows the same unit to be
#'   matched multiple times, on different sets of covariates. In this case,
#'   balancing factor is computing by dividing by the total number of treatment
#'   (control) units, instead of the number of unmatched treatment (control)
#'   units. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
#' @param verbose Controls how FLAME displays progress while running. If 0, no
#'   output. If 1, only outputs the stopping condition. If 2, outputs the
#'   iteration and number of unmatched units every 5 iterations, and the
#'   stopping condition. If 3, outputs the iteration and number of unmatched
#'   units every iteration, and the stopping condition. Defaults to 2.
#' @param return_pe A logical scalar. If \code{TRUE}, the predictive error (PE)
#'   at each iteration will be returned. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
#' @param return_bf A logical scalar. If \code{TRUE}, the balancing factor (BF)
#'   at each iteration will be returned. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
#' @param early_stop_iterations A nonnegative integer, denoting an upper bound
#'   on the number of iterations of FLAME to be performed. If 0, one round of
#'   exact matching is performed before stopping. Defaults to \code{Inf}.
#' @param early_stop_epsilon A nonnegative numeric. If FLAME attemts to drop a
#'   covariate that would raise the PE above (1 + early_stop_epsilon) times the
#'   baseline PE (the PE before any covariates have been dropped), FLAME will
#'   stop. Defaults to 0.25.
#' @param early_stop_control A numeric value between 0 and 1. If
#'   the proportion of control units that are unmatched falls below this value,
#'   FLAME stops. Defaults to 0.
#' @param early_stop_treated A numeric value between 0 and 1. If
#'   the proportion of treatment units that are unmatched falls below this
#'   value, FLAME stops. Defaults to 0.
#' @param early_stop_pe A numeric value between 0 and 1. If FLAME
#'   attempts to drop a covariate that would lead to a PE above this value,
#'   FLAME stops. Defaults to \code{Inf}.
#' @param early_stop_bf A numeric value between 0 and 1. If FLAME
#'   attempts to drop a covariate that would lead to a BF below this value,
#'   FLAME stops. Defaults to 0.
#' @param missing_data If 0, assumes no missingness in \code{data}. If 1, does
#'   not match units with missingness in \code{data}. In this case, the
#'   balancing factor is computed ignoring units with missingness. If 2,
#'   generates \code{missing_data_imputations} imputed datasets via
#'   \code{mice::mice}. In this case, the results of running \code{FLAME} on
#'   each imputed dataset will be returned in a list. Within each of these list
#'   entries, the \code{data} entry will contain the imputed, not missing,
#'   values. If 3, will not match a unit on a covariate that it is missing.
#'   Defaults to 0.
#' @param missing_holdout If 0, assumes no missing data in \code{holdout}. If 1,
#'   eliminates units with missingness from \code{holdout}. If 2, generates
#'   \code{missing_holdout_imputations} imputed datasets via \code{mice::mice}.
#'   In this latter case, all imputations will be used to compute PE, and the PE
#'   at an iteration will be the average across all imputations. Defaults to 0.
#' @param missing_holdout_imputations If \code{missing_holdout} = 2, performs
#'   this many imputations of the missing data in \code{holdout} via
#'   \code{mice::mice}. Defaults to 5.
#' @param missing_data_imputations If \code{missing_data} = 2, performs this
#'   many imputations of the missing data in \code{data} via \code{mice::mice}.
#'   Defaults to 5.
#' @param impute_with_treatment A logical scalar. If \code{TRUE}, uses treatment
#'   assignment to impute covariates when \code{missing_data = 2} or
#'   \code{missing_holdout = 2}. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.
#' @param impute_with_outcome A logical scalar. If \code{TRUE}, uses outcome
#'   information to impute covariates when \code{missing_data = 2} or
#'   \code{missing_holdout = 2}. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
#'
#' @return The basic object returned by \code{FLAME} is a list of 6 entries:
#' \describe{
#' \item{data}{The original data frame with several modifications:
#'   \enumerate{
#'     \item An extra logical column, \code{data$matched},
