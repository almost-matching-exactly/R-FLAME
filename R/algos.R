#' Bit Vectors Implementation of FLAME
#'
#' \code{FLAME} runs the bit-vectors implementation of the FLAME algorithm.
#'
#' @section Introduction:
#' FLAME is a matching algorithm for causal inference that matches units if they
#' match exactly on certain covariates. It starts by making any possible matches
#' on all covariates. It then drops a covariate, makes any possible matches on
#' the remaining covariates, and repeats this process until stopping. The
#' covariate dropped at any given iteration is the one yielding the greatest
#' match quality \eqn{MQ}, defined as \eqn{MQ = C \times BF - PE}. Here,
#' \eqn{BF} denotes the balancing factor, defined as the proportion of unmatched
#' control units, plus the proportion of unmatched treated units, that can now
#' be matched by dropping that covariate. And \eqn{PE} denotes the prediction
#' error, defined as the training error incurred when predicting the outcome
#' from covariates on a separate, holdout set. In this way, FLAME encourages
#' making many matches and also matching on covariates important to the outcome.
#' The hyperparameter \eqn{C} controls the balance between these two objectives.
#' For more details, please see the FLAME paper
#' \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06315.pdf}{here}.
#'
#' @section Stopping Rules:
#' By default, \code{FLAME} stops when 1. all covariates have been dropped or 2.
#' all treatment or control units have been matched. This behavior can be
#' modified by the arguments whose prefix is "early_stop". With the exception of
#' \code{early_stop_iterations}, all the rules come into play \emph{before} the
#' offending covariate is dropped. That is, if \code{early_stop_BF = 0.2} and at
#' the current iteration, dropping the covariate leading to highest match
#' quality is associated with a balancing factor of 0.1, FLAME stops
#' \emph{without} dropping this covariate.
#'
#' @section Missing Data: \code{FLAME} offers functionality for handling missing
#'   data in the covariates, for both the \code{data} and \code{holdout} sets.
#'   This functionality can be specified via the arguments whose prefix is
#'   "missing" or "impute". It allows for ignoring missing data, imputing it, or
#'   (for \code{data}) not matching on missing values. If \code{data} is
#'   imputed, imputation will be done once and the FLAME algorithm will be run
#'   on all imputations. If \code{holdout} is imputed, the predictive error at
#'   an iteration will be the average of predictive errors across all imputed
#'   \code{holdout} datasets.
#'
#'
#' @param data Data to be matched. Either a data frame or a path to a .csv file
#'   to be read into a data frame. Treatment must be described by a logical or
#'   binary numeric column with name \code{treated_column_name}. Outcome must be
#'   described by a column with name \code{outcome_column_name}. The outcome
#'   will be treated as continuous if numeric, as binary if a two-level factor
#'   or numeric with two unique values, and as multi-class if a factor with more
#'   than two levels. The outcome column may be omitted, in which case matching
#'   will be performed but treatment effect estimation will not be possible. All
#'   columns not containing outcome or treatment will be treated as covariates
#'   for matching. Covariates are assumed to be categorical and will be coerced
#'   to factors, though they may be passed as either factors or numeric. If you
#'   wish to use continuous covariates for matching, they should be binned prior
#'   to being passed to \code{FLAME}. There is no default for \code{data}.
#' @param holdout Holdout data to be used to compute predictive error. If a
#'   numeric scalar between 0 and 1, that proportion of \code{data} will be made
#'   into a holdout set and only the remaining proportion of \code{data} will be
#'   matched. Otherwise, a data frame or a path to a .csv file. The holdout data
#'   must contain an outcome column with name \code{outcome_column_name}; other
#'   restrictions on column types are as for \code{data}. Covariate columns must
#'   have the same column names and order as \code{data}. This data will
#'   \emph{not} be matched. Defaults to 0.1.
#' @param C A finite, positive scalar denoting the tradeoff between BF and PE in
#'   the FLAME algorithm. Higher C prioritizes more matches and lower C
#'   prioritizes not dropping important covariates. Defaults to 0.1.
#' @param treated_column_name A character with the name of the treatment column
#'   in \code{data} and \code{holdout}. Defaults to 'treated'.
#' @param outcome_column_name A character with the name of the outcome column in
#'   \code{holdout} and also in \code{data}, if supplied in the latter.
#'   Defaults to 'outcome'.
#' @param PE_method Either "ridge" or "xgb". Denotes the method to be used to
#'   compute PE. If "ridge", uses \code{glmnet::cv.glmnet} with default
#'   parameters and then the default predict method to estimate the outcome. If
#'   "xgb", uses \code{xgboost::xgb.cv} on a wide range of parameter values to
#'   cross-validate and find the best with respect to RMSE (for continuous
#'   outcomes) or misclassification rate (for binary/multi-class outcomes). Then
#'   uses the default \code{predict} method to estimate the outcome. Defaults to
#'   "ridge".
#' @param user_PE_fit An optional function supplied by the user that can be used
#'   instead of those allowed for by \code{PE_method} to fit a model for the
#'   outcome from the covariates. Must take in a matrix of covariates as its
#'   first argument and a vector outcome as its second argument. Defaults to
#'   \code{NULL}.
#' @param user_PE_fit_params A named list of optional parameters to be used by
#'   \code{user_PE_fit}. Defaults to \code{NULL}.
#' @param user_PE_predict An optional function supplied by the user that can be
#'   used to generate predictions from the output of \code{user_PE_fit}. As its
#'   first argument, must take an object of the type returned by
#'  \code{user_PE_fit} and as its second, a matrix of values for which to
#'  generate predictions. When the outcome is binary or multi-class, must
#'  return the maximum probability class label. If not supplied,
#'  defaults to \code{predict}.
#' @param user_PE_predict_params A named list of optional parameters to be used
#'   by \code{user_PE_predict}. Defaults to \code{NULL}.
#' @param replace A logical scalar. If \code{TRUE}, allows the same unit to be
#'   matched multiple times, on different sets of covariates. In this case,
#'   balancing factor is computing by dividing by the total number of treatment
#'   (control) units, instead of the number of unmatched treatment (control)
#'   units. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
#' @param verbose Controls how FLAME displays progress while running. If 0, no
#'   output. If 1, only outputs the stopping condition. If 2, outputs the
#'   iteration and number of unmatched units every 5 iterations, and the
#'   stopping condition. If 3, outputs the iteration and number of unmatched
#'   units every iteration, and the stopping condition. Defaults to 2.
#' @param return_pe A logical scalar. If \code{TRUE}, the predictive error (PE)
#'   at each iteration will be returned. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
#' @param return_bf A logical scalar. If \code{TRUE}, the balancing factor (BF)
#'   at each iteration will be returned. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
#' @param early_stop_iterations A nonnegative integer, denoting an upper bound
#'   on the number of iterations of FLAME to be performed. If 0, one round of
#'   exact matching is performed before stopping. Defaults to \code{Inf}.
#' @param early_stop_epsilon A nonnegative numeric. If FLAME attemts to drop a
#'   covariate that would raise the PE above (1 + early_stop_epsilon) times the
#'   baseline PE (the PE before any covariates have been dropped), FLAME will
#'   stop. Defaults to 0.25.
#' @param early_stop_control A numeric value between 0 and 1. If
#'   the proportion of control units that are unmatched falls below this value,
#'   FLAME stops. Defaults to 0.
#' @param early_stop_treated A numeric value between 0 and 1. If
#'   the proportion of treatment units that are unmatched falls below this
#'   value, FLAME stops. Defaults to 0.
#' @param early_stop_pe Deprecated. A positive numeric. If FLAME
#'   attempts to drop a covariate that would lead to a PE above this value,
#'   FLAME stops. Defaults to \code{Inf}.
#' @param early_stop_bf Deprecated. A numeric value between 0 and 2. If FLAME
#'   attempts to drop a covariate that would lead to a BF below this value,
#'   FLAME stops. Defaults to 0.
#' @param missing_data Specifies how to handle missingness in \code{data}. If
#'   'none' (default), assumes no missing data; if 'drop', effectively drops
#'   units with missingness from the data and does not match them; if 'ignore',
#'   ignores matches on missing covariates; and if 'impute', imputes the missing
#'   data via \code{mice::mice}.
#' @param missing_holdout Specifies how to handle missingness in \code{holdout}.
#'   If 'none' (default), assumes no missing data; if 'drop', effectively drops
#'   units with missingness and does not use them to compute PE; and if 'impute',
#'   imputes the missing data via \code{mice::mice}. In this last case, the PE
#'   at an iteration will be given by the average PE across all imputations.
#' @param missing_holdout_imputations If \code{missing_holdout} = 'impute', performs
#'   this many imputations of the missing data in \code{holdout} via
#'   \code{mice::mice}. Defaults to 5.
#' @param missing_data_imputations Defunct. If \code{missing_data} = 'impute', one
#'   round of imputation will be performed on \code{data} via \code{mice::mice}.
#'   To view results for multiple imputations, please wrap calls to \code{FLAME}
#'   in a loop. This argument will be removed in a future release.
#' @param impute_with_treatment A logical scalar. If \code{TRUE}, uses treatment
#'   assignment to impute covariates when \code{missing_data = 2} or
#'   \code{missing_holdout = 2}. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.
#' @param impute_with_outcome A logical scalar. If \code{TRUE}, uses outcome
#'   information to impute covariates when \code{missing_data = 2} or
#'   \code{missing_holdout = 2}. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
#'
#' @return The basic object returned by \code{FLAME} is a list of 6 entries:
#' \describe{
#' \item{data}{The original data frame with several modifications:
#'   \enumerate{

#'     \item An extra numeric column, \code{data$weight},
#'     that denotes on how many different sets of covariates a unit was matched.
#'     This will only be greater than 1 when \code{replace = TRUE}.
#'     \item Regardless of their original names, the columns denoting treatment
