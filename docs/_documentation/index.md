**R-FLAME** is an **R** package for performing *matching* for *observational causal inference* on datasets containing discrete covariates. It implements the *Fast, Large-Scale Almost Matching Exactly (FLAME)* and *Dynamic Almost Matching Exactly (DAME)* algorithms, which match treatment and control units on subsets of the covariates. The resulting matched groups are interpretable, because the matches are made directly on observed covariates, and high-quality, because machine learning is used to determine which covariates are important to match on.
