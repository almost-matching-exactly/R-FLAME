## FLAME: Fast, interpretable, and accurate methods for estimating causal effects from observational data

---

class: inverse, middle, center, hide-logo

# The Methodology

---

# Causal Inference

Goal: quantify effect of treatment $T \in \{0, 1\}$ on outcome $Y$

--

Two potential outcomes for each unit: $\{Y_i(1), Y_i(0)\}$, denoting response under treatment, control

--

- Only one -- denoted $Y_i$ -- is actually observed

--

- The other, the *counterfactual*, must be estimated from the data

--

In observational data, covariates $\mathbf{X}$ might be confounders

???
Can't naively compare the average outcome of control units to estimate a control counterfactual

---
# (Exact) Matching

One approach to estimating counterfactuals under confounding: *matching*

If, for treated unit $i$, there existed control unit $k$ such that $\mathbf{x}_k = \mathbf{x}_i$, then:

--
- $k$ is a 'good match' for $i$: $Y_k$ is a good estimate of $Y_i(0)$

--

But exact matches are unlikely in high dimensional settings

--

- Settle for $\mathbf{x}_k \approx \mathbf{x}_i$

--

Define a distance metric that:

--
- Prioritizes matches on relevant covariates 

--
- Matches exactly on covariates when possible

# Almost Matching Exactly

Given a unit $i$, covariate weights $\mathbf{w}$, and a covariate selection vector $\boldsymbol{\theta}$, define the AME problem:

$$\text{argmax}_{\boldsymbol{\theta} \in \{0, 1\}^p}\;\boldsymbol{\theta}^T\mathbf{w}\quad\text{s.t.}\\\quad \color{blue}{\exists k\;\:\text{with}\;\: \underbrace{T_{k} = 1 -T_i}_{\text{opposite treatment}} \;\:\text{and}\;\: \underbrace{\mathbf{x}_{k} \circ \boldsymbol{\theta} = \mathbf{x}_{i} \circ \boldsymbol{\theta}}_{\text{exact matching on }\boldsymbol{\theta}}}$$

# Almost Matching Exactly

Given a unit $i$, covariate weights $\mathbf{w}$, and a covariate selection vector $\boldsymbol{\theta}$, define the AME problem:

$$\color{blue}{\text{argmax}_{\boldsymbol{\theta} \in \{0, 1\}^p}\;\boldsymbol{\theta}^T\mathbf{w}\quad\text{s.t.}}\\\quad \exists k\;\:\text{with}\;\: \underbrace{T_{k} = 1 -T_i}_{\text{opposite treatment}} \;\:\text{and}\;\: \underbrace{\mathbf{x}_{k} \circ \boldsymbol{\theta} = \mathbf{x}_{i} \circ \boldsymbol{\theta}}_{\text{exact matching on }\boldsymbol{\theta}}$$

exclude: true
In practice, don't have $\mathbf{w}$; run ML algorithm on _separate_ **holdout** set 

- Compute _Predictive Error_ ( $\mathtt{PE}$ ): error in using a covariate set to predict the outcome

- Determines next covariate set to match on

- Learning a distance metric

???
Going to try and solve the AME problem for units. Way this is going to work in practice is that we're going to pick a theta, starting with a theta of all 1s, which corresponds to exact matching -- the best possible thing we can do -- and match all possible units. Then we're going to choose another theta, and match those units. Bc in practice we don't have fixed covariate weights, for each of these thetas, ..

---
# Almost Matching Exactly: The Algorithms
--

## DAME (Dynamic Almost Matching Exactly)

--

Solves the AME problem *exactly* for each unit

--

Efficient solution via _downward closure_ property
- Only consider dropping a covariate set after all supersets.

--

## FLAME (Fast, Large-scale Almost Matching Exactly)
--

Approximates the exact solution via backwards stepwise selection.

--

At each iteration, eliminate an entire covariate, balancing weights of covariates matched on with the number of matches made

???
Given all this background, it's now very natural and easy to explain two of our methods

# Almost Matching Exactly: Dynamic Weights
Oftentimes don't have a priori measures of covariate importance

--
exclude: true
At every iteration, run ML algorithm on _separate_ **holdout** set to model how well a covariate set predicts the outcome

--
exclude: true
The _Predictive Error_ ( $\mathtt{PE}$ ) measures the error in doing so and determines what covariate set next to match on.

# Other Distance Metrics
- Propensity score matching: match on estimates of $\mathrm{P}(T_i = 1 | \mathbf{X} = \mathbf{x}_i)$
- Prognostic score matching: match on estimates of $Y_i(0)$
- Coarsened exact matching: Coarsen covariates and do exact matching

# Overview of `FLAME`
`FLAME` and `DAME` are the workhorses of the package

Match input data under a wide variety of specifications

Efficient bit-vectors routine for making matches

US 2010 Natality Data (National Center for Health Statistics, NCHS, 2010)

Data on neonatal health outcomes Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)

Effect of "extreme smoking" ( $\geq 10$ cigarettes a day during pregnancy) on birth weight (Kondracki 2020)

Subset of ~500k observations with 16 covariates including sex of infant, races of parents, previous Cesarean deliveries, and others.

# Missing Data
- `missing_data` controls how missing values in `data` are treated
  - 'drop': effectively drop units with missingness from the data
  - 'impute': impute missing values and match on complete dataset
  - 'keep': keep missing values but do not match on them
- `missing_holdout` is analogous, with 'impute' and 'keep' options

---
